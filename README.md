# Vehicle Detection Project

## Overview

This project is made  focuses on detecting vehicles using the YOLOv8 model and tracking them with sort algorithm. This project was created as part of a selection task for an internship at Widya Robotics.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary Python packages installed.
   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Environment**
    - I run and made this code using GPU environment with CUDA and cuDNN support.

## Running the Project

1. **Run the Detection Script**: Execute the `detection.py` script to start the vehicle detection and tracking process.

## Output

- The program will generate an output video showing the results of the vehicle detection and tracking process.
